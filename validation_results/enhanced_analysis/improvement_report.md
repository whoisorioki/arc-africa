# Enhanced Synthetic Dataset Improvement Report

**Comparison:** Current vs Enhanced

## Summary Statistics

| Metric | Current | Enhanced | Improvement |
|--------|---------|----------|-------------|
| Total Samples | 100,000 | 500,000 | +400.0% |
| Unique Primitives | 2 | 17 | +750.0% |
| Average Quality | 0.000 | 0.856 | +inf% |
| Average Complexity | 0.65 | 1.57 | +140.4% |

## Key Improvements

### Quality Improvements
- High-quality samples (>=0.8): 0.0% → 95.4% (+95.4%)

### Diversity Improvements
- Unique primitives: 2 → 17 (+15)
- Complex programs (>=3 primitives): 0.0% → 7.5% (+7.5%)

## Recommendations

1. **Use enhanced dataset for training**: The improved quality and diversity should lead to better neural guide performance.
2. **Monitor primitive balance**: The enhanced dataset provides better coverage of all primitive types.
3. **Validate on evaluation set**: Test the enhanced model on the evaluation set to measure actual performance improvements.
4. **Consider quality filtering**: Use quality threshold >=0.7 for training to focus on high-quality samples.
